Sales-Prediction-using-Python
The project aims to predict sales based on advertising spending using Python. The dataset includes information on advertising budgets for different media channels (TV, radio, and newspaper) and corresponding sales figures. By analyzing this data, the project will develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques. This model will help businesses optimize their advertising budgets by identifying the most effective channels for driving sales. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights that can improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and increase sales revenue.
